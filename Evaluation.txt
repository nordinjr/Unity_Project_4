Intent: To have fun eating plankton and swimming away from a scary dolphin. Play as a jellyfish.

Narrative structure: You are a hungry jellyfish who wants to stay alive and eat all of the yummy plankton.

Mechanics: Point the jellyfish with the arrow keys and steer around. Dolphin moves similar to the jellyfish. Plankton swim around trying to avoid the dolphin and player.

Aesthetics: We used an underwater tilemap that is slightly pixellated. The other sprites match this theme. We used text that is similar to the text on spongebob. The jellyfish has an animation.

Joys:

Struggles: The GameManager kept renaming itself whenever we saved, so we would get an error that took us a while to find the first time.
